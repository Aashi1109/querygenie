It defines the base image, sets up \nenvironment variables, installs software, and configures \nthe container for a specific application or service.\nDockerfile Syntax\nSpecifies the base image for the Docker image.\nFROM:\nFROM\n image_name:tag\n# Example\nFROM ubuntu:20.04\n\nDockerfile Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\nSets the working directory for subsequent instructions.\nWORKDIR:\nCopies files or directories from the build context to the \ncontainer.\nCOPY:\nWORKDIR\n /path/to/directory\n# Example\nWORKDIR\n /app\nCOPY\n host_source_path container_destination_path\n# Example\nCOPY . .\n\nDockerfile Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\nExecutes commands in the shell.\nRUN:\nSets environment variables in the image.\nENV:\nRUN\n command1  command2\n&&\n# Example\nRUN\n apt-get update  apt-get install -y curl\n&&\nENV KEY=VALUE\n# Example\nENV\n NODE_VERSION=14\n\nDockerfile Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\n","Informs Docker that the container listens on specified \nnetwork ports at runtime.\nEXPOSE:\nProvides default commands or parameters for an \nexecuting container.\nOr,\nCMD:\nEXPOSE\n port\n# Example\nEXPOSE 8080\nCMD\n [\"executable\",\"param1\",\"param2\"]\n# Example\nCMD\n [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n\nDockerfile Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\nOr,\nConfigures a container that will run as an executable.\nENTRYPOINT:\nCMD\n executable param1 param2\n# Example\nCMD\n npm run dev\nENTRYPOINT\n [\"executable\",\"param1\",\"param2\"]\n# Example\nENTRYPOINT\n [\"node\", \"app.js\"]\nENTRYPOINT executable param1 param2\n# Example\nENTRYPOINT\n node app.js\n\nDockerfile Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\nDefines variables that users can pass at build-time to the \nbuilder with the docker build command.\nARG:\nCreates a mount point for external volumes or other \ncontainers.\nVOLUME:\nARG \nVARIABLE_NAME\n=default_value\n# Example\nARG\n VERSION=latest\nVOLUME\n /path/to/volume\n# Example\nVOLUME\n /data\n\nDockerfile Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\nAdds metadata to an image in the form of key-value pairs.\nLABEL:\nSpecifies the username or UID to use when running the \nimage.\nUSER:\nLABEL\n key=\"value\"\n# Example\nLABEL version=\"1.0\" maintainer=\"Adrian\"\nUSER user_name\n# Example\nUSER app\n\nDockerfile Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\nSimilar to COPY, but with additional capabilities (e.g., \nextracting archives).\nCopies files or directories and can extract tarballs in the \nprocess.\nADD:\nADD\n source_path destination_path\n# Example\nADD \n./app.tar.gz /app\n\nDockerfile Example\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\n# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image\r\n\nFROM\nWORKDIR\nCOPY\nRUN\nCOPY\nEXPOSE\nENV\nCMD\n node:20-alpine\r\n\n\r\n\n /app\r\n\n\r\n\n package*.json ./\r\n\n\r\n\n npm install\r\n\n\r\n\n . .\r\n\n\r\n\n 8080\r\n\n\r\n\n NODE_ENV=production\r\n\n\r\n\n node app.js\n# Set the working directory to /app\r\n\n# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the \nworking directory\r\n\n# Install dependencies\r\n\n","# Copy the current directory contents to the container \nat /app\r\n\n# Expose port 8080 to the outside world\r\n\n# Define environment variable\r\n\n# Run app.js when the container launches\r\n\n\nDocker\n\nCompose\n\nFile Reference\n\nDocker Compose File Reference\nhttps://jsmastery.proJavaScript Mastery\nWhat is a Docker Compose File?\nA Docker Compose file is a YAML file that defines a multi-\ncontainer Docker application.
